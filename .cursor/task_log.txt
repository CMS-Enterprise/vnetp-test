TASK: Fix pagination error in workflow component - "workflows" ID not matching registered PaginationInstance

ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
- Compared workflow.component vs l3-outs.component app-table usage
- Root cause: Workflow component passes only data array to table, while L3-Outs passes full response object
- Full response object contains pagination metadata needed for ngx-pagination
- Workflow: `this.workflows = response.data` (wrong)  
- L3-Outs: `this.l3Outs = data` (correct)

PLAN:
1. Modify workflow component getWorkflows() method to store full response object instead of just data array
2. Update TypeScript property type from Workflow[] to response DTO type
3. Consider adding missing searchColumns and searchParams binding like L3-Outs has

STATUS: PLAN mode - Analysis complete, ready for implementation
